These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.","","## Features","","In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so."," ","### Existing Features","- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z","- ...","","For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.","","In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:","","### Features Left to Implement","- None","","## Technologies Used","","- [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/)","    - The project uses **HTML** to create web pages.","- [CSS](https://w3.org)","    - The project uses **CSS** to style web pages.","- [Bootstrap 4.4.1](https://getbootstrap.com/)","    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to create responsive mobile first projects.","","## Testing","","HTML for entire site validated  \"Nu HTML Checker\" - https://validator.w3.org/","CSS for entire site validated https://jigsaw.w3.org/","","","In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.","","Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.","","For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:","","1. Contact form:","    1. Go to the \"Contact Us\" page","    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears","    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears","    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.","","In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.","","You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.","","If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.","","## Deployment","","- This site has been deployed directly from the master branch onto GitHub pages.","","## Credits","","### Content","- Biographies for band members copied from www.allmusic.com(https://allmusic.com)","","### Media","- Main Image used on home page - copied from Pinterest","- All images on Band page - copied from Pinterest, ","- Black and white logo on mobile home page - copied from Pinterest","- Colour Small Faces logo on Contact page - copied from Pinterest","- Opaque Small Faces Logo used on home page - copied from Fanart.TV","- Songs from private collection","","","### Acknowledgements","","- I received inspiration for this project from X",""]}],[{"start":{"row":69,"column":11},"end":{"row":70,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":3}],[{"start":{"row":73,"column":9},"end":{"row":74,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":4}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":79,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":74,"column":0},"end":{"row":74,"column":0},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":0},"timestamp":1592247975452,"hash":"242d5d1808762d4b26352328ff5f34c1f23d1770"}
