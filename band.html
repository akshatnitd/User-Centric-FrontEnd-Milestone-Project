        <p class="card-text">The frontman for British hitmakers the Small Faces and Humble Pie, singer/guitarist Steve Marriott was born January 30, 1947 in London; a successful child actor, he played the role of the Artful Dodger in the musical Oliver! as a teen,but by the mid-'60s, he was working in a local music shop. There he met bassist Ronnie Lane, agreeing to jam with his band the Pioneers; Marriott soon joined the group full-time and, after adopting a sound influenced by American R&B and a look inspired by Mod fashions, calling themselves the Small Faces.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Bass Guitar</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Though he is best known as the bassist and occasional vocalist for both the Small Faces and the Faces, Ronnie Lane's musical contributions as a solo artist ought not be overlooked. His songs detail small moments in life, the stories told in a tender voice and backed by a wide variety of acoustic instruments. With his band Slim Chance, Lane released three albums (1974's Anymore for Anymore, 1975's Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance, and 1976's One for the Road) that showed off his expansive songwriting skills, abilities as a musical ringleader, and gentle soul.

        <p class="card-text">Drummer Kenney Jones has been a member of two of England's most beloved and influential rock bands -- the Faces and the Who (although the latter he was a member of only briefly, and well after their prime). Born September 16, 1948 and raised in the East End of London, England, Jones took up the drums at the age of 13, as he and some friends formed a skiffle group. Learning quickly from playing along to recordings by Booker T. & the MG's and the Shadows, Jones became a session drummer by the age of 15.</p>

        <p class="card-text">A keyboard player conversant in R&B, blues, and roots rock who earned an estimable reputation as both a sideman and a bandleader, Ian McLagan was born in Hounslow, Middlesex, England on May 12, 1945. McLagan began playing piano in his early teens, and gained his first stage experience with a group called the Muleskinners, later moving on to Boz and the Boz People, led by Boz Burrell, who would later work with King Crimson and Bad Company.  In November 1965, McLagan joined singer and guitarist Steve Marriott, bass player Ronnie Lane, and drummer Kenney Jones in the British pop/rock band the Small Faces.</p>
