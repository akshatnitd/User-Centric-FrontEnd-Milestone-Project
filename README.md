# User Centric Milestone Project

- This is a website based on one of my favourtie bands The Small Faces.
- T

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## UX

 - This site is for current fans of the Small Faces as well as for new fans just getting in to   their music for the first time.
 - The Band page has biographies for each member of the band provdiding basic informaiton about each musician.
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- A standard nav bar is used to navigate around website which is visible on all devices above 600px. Also clicking
on 'The Small Faces' brings the user back to the homepage. For all devices under 600px the nav bar collaspses in to a hamburber style drop down menu, the nav becomes visible when clicking on the hamburger icon.
For mobile devices the main colour image on the homepage changes to a back and white one.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

- Internet Explorer
  All pages display correctly in Internet Explorer as they do in Google Chrome apart from one, the Store Page. The Store Page is built using a Grid system which is not widely used in IE, therefore the Store Page displays as one singular column as opposed to four, also the audio players styling has been stripped out and offset to the left.

- Firefox - Developer Edition
- All pages displayed correctly compared to Google Chrome
- 
- Microsoft Edge
- Some of the stying on the Audio Player has been stripped out but otherwise all pages display the same when  compared to Google Chrome.
- 

## Deployment

- This site has been deployed directly from the master branch onto GitHub pages.
